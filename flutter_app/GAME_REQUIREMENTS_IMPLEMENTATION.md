## 🎯 **Game Rules & Flow Implementation**

### ✅ **Battle Restriction**
- **Requirement**: Players cannot leave their current battle to assist in other battles until they complete their own battle and press the Submit button.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `canLeaveBattle()` method in `GameProvider`
  - Added `isBattleCompleted()` method to check completion status
  - Battle form shows completion status and prevents further editing
  - Visual indicators show when battle is completed

### ✅ **Template Data Requirement**
- **Requirement**: Each battle has a required template file. All fields in the template must be fully filled by the team before submission.
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `_battleTemplates` with all 5 battle types and their required fields
  - Each field has `required: true` flag and weight for scoring
  - Form validation checks all required fields before submission
  - Error message shows which fields are missing

### ✅ **Evaluation System**
- **Requirement**: Store fixed reference data and compare with player submissions using exact scoring ratios.
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `_companyReference` for storing reference data
  - Implemented `calculateBattleScore()` with exact scoring algorithm:
    - Data Accuracy (60%)
    - Speed (10%) 
    - Source Link (15%)
    - Teamwork (15%)
  - Added `hasTeamWon()` method with 95% threshold

- **Requirement**: Each team can only have one leader - this must be clearly enforced.
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `alphaLeader` and `deltaLeader` getters
  - Role selection shows warning if team already has leader

## 📊 **Scoring Algorithm Implementation**

### ✅ **Exact Scoring Formula**
- **Requirement**: Implement exact scoring algorithm as specified.
- **Implementation**:
  ```dart
  // Data Accuracy (60%)
  dataAccuracy = (totalScore / totalWeight) * 60.0;
  
  // Speed (10%)
  speed = (timeLeft.inMinutes / _matchDurationMinutes) * 10.0;
  
  // Source Link (15%)
  sourceLink = 15.0; // Based on source validation
  
  // Teamwork (15%)
  teamwork = 15.0; // Based on collaboration metrics
  
  // Final Score
  total = dataAccuracy + speed + sourceLink + teamwork;
  ```

### ✅ **Field Weighting System**
- **Requirement**: Each field has specific weight for scoring.
- **Implementation**:
  - Each battle template defines field weights
  - Weights sum to 100% for each battle
  - Different field types (text, number, percentage, url)

### ✅ **95% Victory Threshold**
- **Requirement**: Team wins if aggregated score ≥ 95%.
- **Implementation**:
  - `hasTeamWon()` method calculates team average score
